  * Orphan package, set maintainer to Debian QA Group.
  * Use which instead of “command -v” in svgalib-bin.init.
  * Quote `which file` invokation so that “test -x” does not succeed on an
    empty string, causing svgalib-bin.init to fail when the package is
    removed but not purged. (Closes: #644264)
  * Rename debian/libsvga1.copyright to debian/copyright, and use
    «dh_installdocs --link-doc» instead of manual links through dh_link.
  * Now using Standards-Version 3.9.3 (no changes needed).
  * Remove commented out debhelper commands in debian/rules.
  * Move doc/TODO from libsvga1 to libsvga1-dev, and do not install
    0-README into libsvga1.
  * Make shared library packages multiarch:
    - Build-Depend on debhelper 8.1.3.
    - Add misc:Pre-Depends substvar to Pre-Depends field in libsvga1.
    - Add “Multi-Arch: same” field to libsvga1.
    - Define DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH and use it to set libdir.
    - Change paths from lib/ to lib/* in debian/rules.
  * Cleanup debian/rules targets:
    - Rename build to build-arch, add empty build-indep.
    - Add new build target depending on build-indep and build-arch.
    - Rename install to install-arch.
    - Change install-arch to depend on build-arch.
    - Change binary-arch to depend only on install-arch.
    - Do not do anything in binary-indep.

  * Now using Standards-Version 3.9.1 (no changes needed).
  * Use architecture wildcards:
    - Use linux-any instead of any in binary package Architecture fields.
    - Use any-amd64 and any-i386 in libx86-dev Build-Depends architecture
      restrictions.
  * Port svgalib to GNU/kFreeBSD:
    - Use portable termios instead of termio.
    - Use VT_GETACTIVE instead of VT_GETSTATE on kFreeBSD.
    - Only use c_line member in struct termios on Linux.
    - Handle systems with no SIGPWR.

    - debian/patches/041_use_system_round.patch: New file.
    (Closes: #550775)

    - Remove $local_fs from Required-Stop as we don't do anything on stop.
    - Switch from $local_fs to $remote_fs as we use scripts from /usr.
  * Do not “set -e” on the init script as log_action_end_msg relies on the
    exit code of the command, be it success or failure.
  * Remove long obsolete svgalibg1-dev and svgalibg1 packages.
    (Closes: #322068, #477539)

svgalib (1:1.4.3-23) unstable; urgency=low

    a conffile, and now they are empty. (Closes: #376006)
    - As a side effect, there's no problem anymore with not using the C
      locale when using bracket expressions. (Closes: #343597)

svgalib (1:1.4.3-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * QA upload.
  * src/driver.h: Increase MAX_REGS to 11196 for Alliance ProMotion AT24.
  * src/libvga.h: libc5 LinuxThreads internally used SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2, so
    svgalib had to make do with SIGPROF/SIGUNUSED; this is not necessary
    for libc6, which uses real-time signals.  (Well, only on 2.1.70 and
    later kernels, but 2.0 is no longer supported by modutils anyway.)
    Profiling should work now.  Closes: #66775.
  * utils/svgakeymap: Default to /usr/share/keymaps/i386/qwerty/us.kmap
    rather than /usr/share/keymaps/us.map.  Closes: #109682.
  * debian/svgalibg1.postrm: Remove /etc/vga only if it is empty, the way
    dpkg would.

  * Move doc/Driver-programming-HOWTO from svgalibg1 to svgalibg1-dev.
  * Move debian/README.svgalib-dummy from svgalib-bin to svgalibg1-dev.
  * Leave out 0-INSTALL.
  * Remove non-essential output from maintainer scripts.
  * Makefile: Timestamp for doc/man7/svgalib.7 seems to have changed
    accidentally; no need to regenerate 0-README.
  * Makefile.cfg:
    - Remove `DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=debug' support and enable `-g' by default.
    - Let dh_strip handle `DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nostrip'.
  * debian/rules:
    - Use dh_installman and Bash globbing extensions to replace the
      byzantine rules.manpages.
    - Installing directly into package build directories involves less
      work than with debian/tmp and dh_install.
    - Compress examples as tarballs rather than individually (saves 292K).
    - `TARGET_FORMAT=elf', `USEGLIBC=yes' are default now.

  * src/nvvga.h, src/vgaio.c, src/vgaio.h: Unused; remove.
  * 0-RELEASE: Origin uncertain, last updated in 1999; remove.
  * README.glibc2: `-DUSEGLIBC' no longer necessary; remove.
  * doc/README.kernel-2.3: `BACKGROUND=y' already commented out; remove.
  * doc/SECURITY.advisory: Fixed in 1997 (1.2.11); remove.
  * debian/lintian/svgalib-bin: Lintian no longer issues `setuid-binary'
    warnings for svgalib programs; remove.
  * debian/make-symlinks: No longer necessary; remove.
  * debian/svgalibg1.postinst: Remove 1.2.8 compatibility code from 1996.
  * debian/svgalibg1.preinst: Remove /etc compatibility code from 1997.

  * QA upload.
  * Fix restorefont, restorepalette segfaults on framebuffer device
    (probably this is fix for #128164 and #128165, but this needs more
     testing, so I'm not closing the bugs now.)
    + src/vga.c: check in vga_(get|put)textfont functions if font_buf1
      was initialized. Because the variable was NULL on FBDev, memcpy()
      caused segmentation fault error.
    + restorefont.c: set font_size to FONT_SIZE as defined in libvga.h
    + restorepalette.c: does nothing if chipset is FBDev.

  * savetextmode and textmode now use $HOME/.vga if we don't have write
    permission for /etc/vga directory. Documented the change in manpage
    (closes: #61625).

  * Change .so requests in manpages into symlinks. Hopefully it is only
    thing that got broken during repackaging.
  * svgalib-bin should conflit with suidmanager, not suidregister.
  * svgalib-bin.preinst: remove unwanted statoverrides.
  * Standards-Version: 3.5.6
  * Handle DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=debug,nostrip.
  * Don't use -V option of dh_makeshlibs - versioned dependencies on svgalib1g
    would probably make svgalib1-libggi2 package unusable.

  * Svgalib programs can use the mouse device even when the device is only readable

    some information has changed (albeit only the distribution).
  * See the -2 changelog for more details, but this upload fixes an
    important bug (and several smaller ones), and should therefore go into
    frozen.
  * Upgraded to latest standards version.
  * Fix typos in package descriptions (should fix #18964).

svgalib (1:1.2.13-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use suidmanager to set permissions on setuid binaries, if it's installed.
  * Fix file permissions (fixes #18182, and about 300 lintian warnings).
  * Add mouse type `unconfigured' which displays a message if a program
    tries to access the mouse, and make it the default. (fixes #13458)
  * Don't depend on svgalib | svgalib-dummy in shlibs (fixes #18091).
  * New mouse type "unconfigured," now the default (fixes #13979). In order to
    avoid annoying the Microsoft mouse owners too much, the prerm/postinst
    contains new code to keep the mouse settings transparently across
    upgrades (see /etc/vga/libvga.config). Those who still have the
    default config file will have to edit it once to get the microsoft
    mouse back, but svgalib will then track the upstream file without
    prompting at every upgrade.
  * Don't run ldconfig any more.
  * All doc files now go in /usr/doc/svgalibg1, and /usr/doc/svgalib is a
    symlink to it, rather than the other way round, to keep lintian happy.

  * svgalib-bin now Replaces: svgalib1-bin (fixes #15082).
  * Increased MAX_REGS to 405 in src/driver.h (fixes #13126).
  * New upstream release. Major features:
    - All calls now have manpages! Interestingly enough, this doesn't seem
      to close any bugs. As a result of this, many README files have been
      removed.
    - "Complete new style vga_accel support for Mach32."
    - Extended fontbuffer in the library and in restorefont, to fix font
      corruption problems with new kernels (fixes #12445).
    - Added TVGA9440 support.
  * Change /dev/console to /dev/tty0 (to which it is normally, but
    apparrently not always, a symlink) (fixes #10584)
  * My first personal release as maintainer.

svgalib (1:1.2.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is a more or less non-maintainer release to finally bring out a
    libc6 version of svgalib, which is urgently needed for the libc6
    migration of all packages depending on it. This release has been mode
    together by Joost Witteveen <joost@rulcmc.leidenuniv.nl> and Roman
    Hodek <Roman.Hodek@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>. But we both don't want
    to be maintainers for svgalib, if you want it, it's available.
  * New upstream release (made some of Joost's libc6 changes unnecessary)
  * removed aout stuff.
  * changed names of packages:
     svgalib1     ->  svgalibg1       (libc6)
     svgalib1-dev ->  svgalibg1-dev   (libc6)
     svgalib1-dev ->  svgalib1-altdev (libc5)
     svgalib1-bin ->  svgalib-bin     (there's no reason to put soname in
                                       a package that uses svgalib1g, I'd say).
     aout-svgalib ->  -               (obvious)
  * Changed most of the Depends/Conflicts/Replaces:
    -the shared libs now don't conflict/replaces old versions any more
     (different package names, should be possible to install
     simultaniously)
    -the -dev and -bin packages don't Replaces: svgalib any more 
     (why was this ever done? seems strange to me).
    -svgalib1 (libc5 shared libs) must depend on svgalibg1, because there
     are the config files...
  * changed the directory of the documentation to svgalib, as the docs
    are common to all programmes, and svgalib seems the only common
    denominator.
  * removed $(MAKE) -f debian/rules buildclean from the "binary" target.
    (why was this ever put there?)
  * rewrote about every line of debian/rules for easy soname/minor name
    changes (now uses variable $(soname), etc).
  * allow libsvga to compile if libsvga-dev isn't installed on the
    system (why wasn't this possible before?)
  * removed call of ldconfig in Makefile that was executed in
    the debian/rules binary target: I don't want my system to be
    reconfigured when building packages.
  * also removed uninstall dependency of install target, it can affect the
    installation of the compiling system...
  * Changed #ifdef USEGLIC in upstream sources to #if __GLIBC__ >= 2,
    cause __GLIBC__ is predefined. Patch forwarded upstreams.
  * Added $(SHLIBLIBS) when linking the shared libs; the value ("-lc") is
    defined only from debian/rules. This adds a dependency to libc that is
    needed by ld-linux.so.
  * Removing of obsolete symlinks in /etc from preinst now works.
